## Description

## About program

## Design Assumptions
1. Using camelCase.
2. Brackets ({ }) adding in next line.
3. Functions shouldn't have more than 60 lines of code but we can have exceptions.
4. Using english in code and commits.
5. In functions names using camelCase too, for example functionDoSomething().
6. Adding comments with understandable descriptions behind functions.
7. If condition/loop has one line of code adding brackets all the same.
8. Private variables and private methods preceding "_".
9. Taking care of formatting code.
10. Adding comments in difficult functions.
